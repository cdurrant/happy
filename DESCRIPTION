Description: happy is an R interface into the HAPPY C package
 for fine-mapping Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) in Heterogenous
 Stocks (HS). An HS is an advanced intercross between (usually
 eight) founder inbred strains of mice. HS are suitable for
 fine-mapping QTL. The happy package is an extension of the
 original C program happy; it uses the C code to compute the
 probability of descent from each of the founders, at each
 locus position, but the happy packager allows a much richer
 range of models to be fit to the data.
